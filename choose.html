        <p>
          Your journey begins like most, inside a tavern. You overhear two men from another table taking about a cave deep in the forest
          that holds a wonderous treasure. Of course, many have entered but none have ever returned. Well, treasure is great but wonderous treasure? That sounds like something to risk your life over! 
          Suddenly on the other side of the tavern you hear someone yell and a see a table get flipped. A brawl errupts in the far end of the tavern. What will you do?
        </P>
